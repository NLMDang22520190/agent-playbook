# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-09
- Precedence over overlapping skills: the always-on block and `playbook-tdd` state that the
  playbook's role split, reviewer re-run and batched questions win over Superpowers
  `test-driven-development`, `subagent-driven-development` and `brainstorming`. Eval E11.
- New skill `playbook-feedback` and `scripts/feedback.sh`: capture evidenced improvement proposals
  quietly, ask at most once per interval at the end of a task, preview, then file GitHub issues
  (duplicate search, labels, redaction, offline-safe). Eval E12. `tools/setup-labels.sh`, issue template.
- `install.sh update`: fetch release tags, show the changelog, check out the newest tag (or `--to`
  for rollback) and re-install every recorded target (registry `.install-targets`, including copy-mode
  Windows homes); `--check` only reports. Install and uninstall maintain the registry.
- CI: GitHub Actions runs the full suite on Ubuntu and macOS (bash 3.2 / BSD tools).
- Setup asks for `feedback_repo` and `feedback_interval_days`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-09

  learnings pointers, first-run setup.
